# Elsa Maneval

Welcome ! Since September 2024, I am a **PhD student in Mathematics** at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. I work under the supervision of Dimitri Wyss in the Chair of Arithmetic Geoemtry.

I work in the area of enumerative geometry. In particular, I am focusing on the use of p-adic and motivic integration techniques on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles.
