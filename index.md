# Elsa Maneval

Welcome!  
Since September 2024, I am a **PhD student in Mathematics** at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

I work under the supervision of **Dimitri Wyss** in the **Chair of Arithmetic Geometry**.

Previously, I studied at **École Normale Supérieure (Ulm)** in Paris and at **Sorbonne Université**.

I am interested in the use of **p-adic** and **motivic integration** techniques on **moduli spaces of Higgs bundles** and their **mirror symmetry** features.

## Learning groups

- In Fall 2025, with Sebastian Schlegel Mejia, we organised a [learning group](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/cohomology-of-symmetric-stacks-MATH-675) on the preprint [Cohomology of Symmetric Stacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04253).
- In Fall 2024, with Archi Kaushik, we organised a learning group on *Intersection (Co)homology and Perverse Sheaves*.
